<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Next Task][product-screenshot]](https://nexttask.vercel.app/)

There are many Tasks Managers around the web, but I'm trying to create an easy-to-use one. The objective is to create an intuitive and visually appealing way for you to control your tasks around the day.

It's an app still in development, so it may change a lot as its development goes.

### Built With

This project was built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Framer API](https://www.framer.com/api/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

The following steps are the description of how you can set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have yarn installed to install the required packages.

[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

You'll also need Node.js installed. Download it from the link below.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/parvic/to-do-list.git
   ```
2. Install yarn packages
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Creating a task

1. Our app allows you to create tasks to remind you of things you need to do. To create a new task, you must click on add (+) button.
2. After that, a modal will open asking the user to fill out some fields, like a title for the task, the priority level, and a description. Once done, you can add the task to your list by clicking on the Register button.
3. You can see the task in your list. The newest tasks are shown on top of the list.

### Deleting a task

1. Simply clicking on the trash can button, you can remove a task from your task listing. Keep in mind that deleting a task from the list is permanent.

### Finishing a task

1. To finish a task, you can just click on the checkbox, and the task will be finished. It will disappear from the task list but will be added to a list of completed tasks.
